The modern investment landscape increasingly leverages advanced technologies to yield accurate and timely insights. Data-driven financial advice empowers individuals and institutions in informed decision-making, portfolio optimisation, and complex financial market navigation, contributing to financial stability and growth. With vast data available in annual reports filed by public companies, effectively harnessing this information is crucial to guiding investors. Therefore, this project utilises Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques integrating LlamaIndex and Phi-3 to analyse these reports and generate financial advice. Though underperforming GPT 4.0 in complex tasks like analysis and inference, this RAG can reasonably respond to investorsâ€™ queries on a certain level of information summarisation and extraction, thus, offering foundation knowledge and directions for further exploration.
